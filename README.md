## What is CortexON?

Under the hood, CortexON integrates multiple specialized agents that dynamically collaborate to accomplish user-defined objectives. These specialized agents include:

- **Web Agent:** Handles real-time internet searches, data retrieval, and web interactions.
- **File Agent:** Manages file operations, organization, data extraction, and storage tasks.
- **Coder Agent:** Generates, debugs, and optimizes code snippets across various programming languages.
- **Executor Agent:** Executes tasks, manages workflows, and orchestrates inter-agent communications.
- **API Agent:** Integrates seamlessly with external services, APIs, and third-party software to extend automation capabilities.

Together, these agents dynamically coordinate, combining their unique capabilities to effectively automate complex tasks.

## Quick Start Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** - Required for backend services
- **Node.js 18+** - Required for frontend development
- **Git** - For cloning the repository

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following required variables:

#### Anthropic API
- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_NAME=claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key`

Obtain your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com).

#### Browserbase Configuration
- `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=your_browserbase_api_key`
- `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_browserbase_project_id`

Set up your account and project at [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com).

#### Google Custom Search
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key`
- `GOOGLE_CX=your_google_cx_id`

Follow the steps at [Google Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview).

#### Logging
- `LOGFIRE_TOKEN=your_logfire_token`

Create your token at [LogFire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire).

#### Vault Integration (OPTIONAL)
- `VITE_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- `VITE_APP_VA_NAMESPACE=your_unique_namespace_id` (format unrestricted, UUID recommended)
- `VA_TOKEN=your_vault_authentication_token`
- `VA_URL=your_vault_service_endpoint`
- `VA_TTL=24h`
- `VA_TOKEN_REFRESH_SECONDS=43200`

This project uses HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault for secure secrets management. While you can either self-host Vault or use HCP Vault, we recommend using HCP Vault for the best managed experience. For HCP Vault Dedicated cluster setup, follow the [official HashiCorp documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/get-started-hcp-vault-dedicated/create-cluster).

#### WebSocket
- `VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8081/ws`

### Python Setup

1. Clone the CortexON repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheAgenticAI/CortexOn.git
cd CortexOn
```

2. Run the automated setup script:
```sh
python setup.py
```

This will:
- Install all Python dependencies for backend services
- Install Playwright browsers for web automation
- Install Node.js dependencies for the frontend
- Create service startup scripts

3. Start all services:
```sh
python start_all.py
```

Or start services individually:
```sh
# Start only the backend
python start_cortex_on.py

# Start only the browser service  
python start_ta_browser.py

# Start only the frontend
python start_frontend.py
```

### Access Services
